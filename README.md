### üçèAbout the project
___
‚Ä£ Introducing ReceiveApp. A program for searching for dishes based on available products. You can also see the calorie rate for the day.

### üëÄHow to install and run a project from **GitHub** in your IDE:

---
Step 1: Cloning the repository
- First, clone the repository with the project from GitHub. You can use the `git clone' command in the command line or terminal:
   ```
   git clone <repository URL>
   ```
   Replace `<repository URL>` with the URL of the actual repository on GitHub.

Step 2: Go to the project directory
- Change to the project directory using the `cd` command:
   ```
   cd <project directory name>
   ```
   Replace `<project directory name>` with the name of the actual project directory you cloned.

Step 3: Installing dependencies
- In the command line or terminal, execute the `npm install` command to install all project dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.

Step 4: Setting up the MongoDB database
- Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running. If you are using a remote MongoDB database, make sure you have the correct connection information, such as the URL, database name, and credentials.

Step 5: Project configuration
- Open the project files that contain the database settings and make sure they are configured correctly for your MongoDB database. Usually, such settings can be found in the `config.js` or `database.js` file.

Step 6: Launching the project
- In the command line or terminal, execute the command `node app.js` or `npm start` to start the project.
   ```
   node app.js
   ```
   or
   ```
   npm start
   ```

Now your Node.js project using the MongoDB database should be successfully installed and running. Make sure that all dependencies are installed and the database is configured correctly to avoid possible errors.
